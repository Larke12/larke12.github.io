Hello.

My name is Ryan Hammett, and I am currently a Senior Computer Science student at York College of Pennsylvania. This website houses most of my works since high school, showcasing the various skills I have achieved through my classes and projects. My writings are still in the process of being uploaded, but are available upon request. I am currently looking for an internship in relation to my Computer Science major so that I may expand my horizons beyond programming and game design. So far I have dabbled in HTML/CSS, C/++, Java, Ruby, Clojure and more recently Qt.

For more about me and the rest of my works, [check out my website here](http://www.ryanhammett.com/).

Enjoy!
