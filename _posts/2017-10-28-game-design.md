## Now

### To be continued?

During college I learned the truth and ferocity of the game design world. To be a developer in this career would require a daily life to which I'm not fond, and so I've shifted my puruits. I don't recall what article lead me to this conclusion, but if you happen to be intereted in game design I highly encourage looking for articles about the realities of game design. I'd love to dabble in game design again someday, for fun, so until then enjoy what I've done below.

## College

### [Cave of Despair](../../assets/Cave_of_Despair_Game_rhammett.swf) 
<em>Flash</em>

This game was created in my first semester of college with the help of my friends Aaron Kirby and Josiah Watts. Much of what I did was in the general coding and story/decision making. It is fully playable, with a few possible bugs. Enjoy the tale of saving your friend from harm!

### [Terminal Pellets](../../assets/champ.tar.gz)
<em>C/C++ (tar.gz)</em>

This game was created in my second semester of college, with some code given to us from our instructor. It’s essentially Pacman in C++. A lot of work (at the time) was put into this game, along with bonus levels and elements not required by the basic grading scale. Requires you make the program in your POSIX systems terminal.

## High School

### Old Game Design Home Page

Contained all works from my high school career. From the games below, to small labs we created and learned. The site itself was also used to show off our web design and Flash works. The site has since been terminited, so this is just a small memento to what once was.

### Class of 2012 Game Design Page

This site contained a selection of games from my Game Design class at Kennard-Dale High School. The domain no longer resolved, so this is yet another memento to past shenanigans.

### [Lost Woods Adventure](../../assets/advent_lost.swf)
<em>Flash</em>

An adventure game where you drag and drop your items to unlock mysteries and advance to the Master Sword’s pedestal! Needless to say, this game is based upon The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Music by Zelda Reorchestrated.

### [Clock Tower Shooter](../../assets/shot.swf)
<em>Flash</em>

Another game inspired by The Legend of Zelda series, this time from The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask. Help Clock Town rid the tower of Poe’s with your Hero’s Bow! You have met with a terrible fate, haven’t you?

### [Pong](../../assets/ponga.swf)
<em>Flash</em>

The classic game of Pong! Features singleplayer and multiplayer modes, with minor glitches and distracting graphics.

### [Platz Former’s Adventure](../../assets/platform_fix.swf)
<em>Flash</em>

A platformer with a small inspiration from Kirby. Save the townsfolk by collecting enough coins before they disappear!

### [3D Maze](../../assets/maze_game.blend)
<em>Blender File</em>

A 3D maze game that can be run using <a href="http://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a>. Download the file and open in Blender, then press 'P' to begin the maze game.
