I am currently a staff member on two fan sites, <a href="https://www.linkshideaway.com/">Link’s Hideaway</a> (LH) and <a href="http://www.nintendocastle.com/">Nintendo Castle</a> (NC). I am the (Unofficial) Co-Webmaster for LH, and “unofficial” due to my lack of knowledge in certain areas of code to be considered “official”. I do graphic design, news, content, (past) podcast host and editor, and various other duties to keep the site running. Much of what the site does, and will do, has and still is giving me the opportunity for a greater view of web design. From the custom CMS in use, to better SEO practices, and even better writing.

I am mainly the Podcast Dude and Graphic Artist for NC. I help keep the podcast running and maintain it as needed. I also do much of the graphics you will find on the site. Version 4.0 of the site was mainly edited and compiled by myself. That included replacing the old menu with images, new social icons, moving original code to other files, creating new code to help keep the site looking nice. It was a great chance to re-learn the basics of HTML, and to further my knowledge of PHP, CSS design.

Since taking Literary Publishing I have been in charge of the <a href="http://www.yorkreview.org/">York Review</a> website. I manage the PDF archives, online content, and design of the website. Almost everything seen has been implemented or altered by me, especially the CSS that is still a work in progress. I have also extended this reach to the Tumblr and Twitter designs. My current goal is to work on the mobile view of the site with the themes given design (purely CSS and HTML, no plugins/Jetpack theme). I’m also attempting to use LESS on the website, an “extension” of CSS.

## Past Works

At Kennard-Dale High School I took Web Design I and Web Design II (intro to programing and web development classes). Below are a list of sites I was a webmaster for, or created entirely as an assignment. I no longer work on these sites, and only Kennard-Dale’s design has been greatly altered since my involvement.

<a href="http://feltonfireco.org/" target="_blank">Felton Union Volunteer Fire Company</a> — Felton, Pennsylvania — Creator, create site containing all information needed for general public and set up Google services for ease of use

Kennard-Dale High School — Fawn Grove, Pennsylvania — Student Webmaster, kept entire site up-to-date and aided teachers and staff with usage
