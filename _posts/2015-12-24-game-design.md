## College

### [Cave of Despair](../../assets/Cave_of_Despair_Game_rhammett.swf) 
<em>Flash</em>

This game was created in my first semester of college with the help of my friends Aaron Kirby and Josiah Watts. Much of what I did was in the general coding and story/decision making. It is fully playable, with a few possible bugs. Enjoy the tale of saving your friend from harm!

### Chomp!
<em>C/C++</em>

This game was created in my second semester of college, with some code given to us from our instructor. It’s essentially Pacman in C++. A lot of work was put into this game, along with bonus levels and elements not required by the basic grading scale. <b>Looking for the file to upload</b>.
